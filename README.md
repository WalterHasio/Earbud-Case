Earbud storage case, in two sizes.  The 3.5mm versions have slots for the 3.5mm jack.  (added a large and XL versions, but haven't tried printing them)  
The first 0.4mm works as a hinge, I used clear PET for the first couple of layers since it work better as a hinge material and works as a window, but ABS will work too.  Take a look at the picture with the orange cases to see how it works.
